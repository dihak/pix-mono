# pix-data

Pi coding agent extension — shared model data layer. Warms two cached
data sources on session start so other extensions (model picker, footer,
subagent resolver) can read context window, pricing, and a coding-focused
score/rank synchronously without redundant network calls:

- **[modelgrep](https://modelgrep.com)** — the model catalog (context window,
  pricing, modalities, capabilities, raw benchmark fields) used as the
  authoritative source when present.
- **[benchlm.ai](https://benchlm.ai)** — a leaderboard of 0–100 coding scores
  used as a fallback when modelgrep's `artificial_analysis` block is null
  (currently the common case for the long tail of models).

Both caches live under `~/.cache/pi/` and are shared across every Pi
extension using the same `DataSource` class — whichever extension loads
first populates the cache; subsequent extensions read from disk.

## Data sources

- **`modelgrep`** — `GET /api/v1/models?sort=coding&order=desc&limit=200`,
  paginated up to 10 pages (`meta.has_more` / `next_offset`). Free, no API key.
  modelgrep aggregates benchmark numbers from
  [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai). Context window, pricing,
  and modalities are taken verbatim from the catalog.
- **`benchlm`** — `GET https://benchlm.ai/api/data/leaderboard`. Free, no API
  key. Each entry has an `overallScore` (0–100) used as the fallback score
  when modelgrep's `artificial_analysis` block is null.

Cache files:

- `~/.cache/pi/modelgrep.json` (TTL 24h)
- `~/.cache/pi/benchlm.json` (TTL 24h)

On outage the stale cache keeps the picker working until it can refresh.

## Scoring methodology

The score a model receives is the first of the following that succeeds, in
order:

1. **Primary = [Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index](https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology/intelligence-benchmarking)**
   when present on the modelgrep entry — AA's authoritative composite of 9
   independent evals (agents, coding, scientific reasoning, general), already
   weighted toward agentic work. Rescaled to 0–100
   (`intelligence / 65 × 100`; the current leader scores ~65).
2. **Heuristic** from modelgrep's raw benchmark fields when the AA index is
   absent. Weighted blend of the same family of evals AA uses, then mapped onto
   the index scale by a least-squares line. Both the heuristic weights *and*
   the line were jointly tuned against the index on the models that carry
   *both* it and the raw benches (`index100 ≈ 120.6·heuristic − 10.6`, deduped
   n=29, R²=0.901, leave-one-out RMSE 6.55pt) — a data calibration, not a
   guessed penalty. The picker exists to choose a model *for coding work in an
   agent*, so the heuristic is weighted toward exactly that:

| bench | range | measures |
|---|---|---|
| `coding` | 0–100 | code generation index |
| `scicode` | 0–1 | scientific coding |
| `tau2` | 0–1 | agentic tool-use |
| `agentic` | 0–100 | agentic index |
| `gpqa` | 0–1 | graduate-level reasoning |
| `hle` | 0–1 | hard-exam reasoning |

When the index is absent, three sub-scores combine, each a weighted blend of
its benches (all normalized to 0–1):

```
coding_score    = 0.60·(coding/100) + 0.40·scicode
agentic_score   = 0.70·tau2         + 0.30·(agentic/100)
reasoning_score = 0.60·gpqa         + 0.40·hle

heuristic = 0.30·coding_score + 0.60·agentic_score + 0.10·reasoning_score
score     = round(clamp₀₁₀₀(120.6·heuristic − 10.6))   // fitted to the index
```

1. **benchlm.ai fallback** — if the model exists in benchlm but modelgrep has
   no AA index and no raw benches, look up the benchlm `overallScore` (0–100)
   and use it verbatim. Match strategy (in `lookupBenchlmScore`): exact
   normalized slug, then prefix overlap either way, then take the
   highest-scoring match on a tie.

**Why a heuristic at all, and why these raw evals only:** the AA Intelligence
Index *is* the ideal number — but only ~16% of the catalog has it. For the rest
we rebuild a comparable score from the same family of raw evals. Crucially we
use each raw eval **once** and never feed `intelligence` *and* its components
together, nor any `_pct` field (which is just a percentile-rank of a raw field)
— doing so would double-count the same measurement and silently inflate weights
you can't see. Independent inputs only → honest weighted average.

**Why these weights:** an agentic coding model lives or dies on *tool-calling*
and *code generation*, so `agentic_score` (0.60) and `coding_score` (0.30)
carry the score; pure reasoning (0.10) is a tiebreaker, not the headline. The
split is not arbitrary — a grid search over weight combinations, scored by how
well the heuristic predicts the AA index (leave-one-out cross-validation),
landed on this agentic-heavy mix. Within each group the dominant bench (`tau2`
for agentic, raw `coding`, `gpqa`) carries most of the weight and a secondary
bench refines it.

**Missing benchmarks:** every blend renormalizes over the fields actually
present, so a model missing one bench is diluted only *within its own group* —
it is never zero-penalized or dropped. A model with no benchmarks at all gets a
`null` score (shown as a bare row) and sorts to the bottom.

The exact implementation is `codingScore()` in
[`src/data.ts`](src/data.ts); the weights are intentionally easy to tune in one
place if your priorities differ.

## Unified config — `~/.pi/agent/pix.json`

pix-data hosts the **single shared config file** consumed by every `pix-*` package. The file is auto-created with defaults on the first session that loads pix-data — you never need to create it manually.

**Location:** `~/.pi/agent/pix.json`

### Full schema

```jsonc
{
  // Auto-collapse for tool output cards (pix-bash, pix-read, pix-grep, …)
  "collapse": {
    "enabled": true,          // master switch
    "delaySec": 10,            // seconds before collapse fires (default 10)
    "tools": {
      // per-tool overrides — set false to disable for a specific tool
      "bash":   true,
      "read":   true,
      "grep":   true,
      "edit":   true,
      "write":  true,
      "find":   true,
      "ls":     true,
      "todo":   true,
      "agent":  true,
      "fetch":  true,
      "search": true,
      "sudo":   true
    }
  },

  // Rendering options (pix-pretty)
  "pretty": {
    "syntaxTheme": "monokai",       // syntax-highlight theme (overrides PRETTY_THEME)
    "icons": "nerd",          // icon mode: nerd | unicode | ascii (overrides PRETTY_ICONS)
    "lsStyle": "grid",        // ls output layout: "grid" (horizontal) | "tree" (vertical)
    "maxPreviewLines": 50,    // overrides PRETTY_MAX_PREVIEW_LINES
    "diffColors": true        // colored diff output
  },

  // Gate rules (pix-gate)
  "gate": {
    "disableDefaults": false,
    "extraRules": [],          // same shape as pix-gate.json extraRules
    "autoApprove": []          // regex strings that skip the dialog
  }
}
```

All sections are optional — missing keys fall back to the defaults shown above. Environment variables (e.g. `PRETTY_THEME`) still take precedence over `pix.json` values.

### API — `@dihak/pix-data/pix-config`

```ts
import { pixConfig, reloadPixConfig } from "@dihak/pix-data/pix-config";

const cfg = pixConfig();          // returns cached PixConfig (loaded once per session)
await reloadPixConfig();          // force re-read from disk (e.g. after /config reload)
```

### API — `@dihak/pix-data/collapse`

```ts
import { shouldCollapse, collapseDelayMs, tickCollapse } from "@dihak/pix-data/collapse";

// In a terminal tool result renderer:
const collapsed = tickCollapse(
  "bash",
  renderContext.state,
  renderContext.invalidate,
  renderContext.expanded,
);
if (collapsed) {
  // Return the tool's one-line compact status row.
}
```

- `shouldCollapse(tool)` — returns `true` when `collapse.enabled` is true and the named tool is not opted out.
- `collapseDelayMs()` — converts `collapse.delaySec` to milliseconds (default `10000`).
- `tickCollapse(tool, state, invalidate, expanded?)` — installs at most one timer in the per-card state and returns `true` when the elapsed card should render its compact row. Passing `expanded: true` restores the normal detailed renderer without clearing or restarting the elapsed timer; leaving expanded mode therefore returns immediately to the compact row. Running and partial results should not call this helper.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@dihak/pix-data
```

## How it works

On session start the extension fires two non-blocking fetches in parallel
(`modelgrep.get()` and `benchlm.get()`) — Pi session start is not gated on
either. If the cache is fresh both fetches are skipped. The cache files live
in `~/.cache/pi/` — any Pi extension using the same `DataSource` shares them
automatically.
